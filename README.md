Hello! My name is Veena Calambur (vc233@cornell.edu) and I am an undergraduate junior at Cornell University. I am planning to graudate in December 2015

I am an Information Science and Statistics double major in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences 

I became intersted in studying Data Science during the 2008 presidential elections when I saw how news stations were able to project election predictions even with several months to go until the elections. And with the 2016 elections coming around the corner, I would love to get involved in a project that looks at predicting who the front runners of elections will be for the primaries
